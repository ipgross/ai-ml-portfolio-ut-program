# Project 2 â€” Neural Networks (Bank Churn Prediction)

ðŸ“Œ **Personal / Academic project (outside of EA).**

---

## Overview
Banks lose customers every month, and manual retention strategies arenâ€™t scalable.  
This project builds a **neural network classifier** to predict which customers are most likely to churn in the next 6 months, allowing retention teams to intervene early.

- **Goal:** Predict churn risk with high recall so fewer high-risk customers are missed  
- **Key Skills:** Deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras, handling imbalanced data (SMOTE), regularization with Dropout, model tuning (SGD vs Adam)

## Contents
- [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb) â†’ Colab notebook with EDA, model building, and evaluation  
- [slides.pdf](./slides.pdf) â†’ presentation summarizing business problem, approach, results  
- [data.csv](./data.csv) â†’ dataset used for training/testing  

---

## Results
- Final model: **Neural Network with SMOTE + Adam + Dropout**  
- **Recall:** ~78%  
- **Precision:** ~46%  
- **F1 Score:** ~58%  
- **Accuracy:** ~77%  
- Key churn drivers: geography (Germany), inactivity, older age (45+), low product count  

---

## Business Takeaways
- Use the model to **flag at-risk customers** for proactive outreach (offers, support, incentives)  
- Retrain quarterly as new data arrives  
- Add explainability tools (e.g., SHAP) to provide retention teams with actionable insights
