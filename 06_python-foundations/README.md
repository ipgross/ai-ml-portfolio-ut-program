# Project 6 ‚Äî Python Foundations (FoodHub Data Analysis)

üìå **Personal / Academic project (outside of EA).**

---

## Overview
This project demonstrates **data analysis and Python foundations** through an exploration of **FoodHub‚Äôs customer order data**.  
The goal was to analyze operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue drivers to provide actionable business recommendations.

- **Business Problem:** FoodHub wanted insights to improve restaurant promotions, optimize delivery times, and enhance customer experience.  
- **Goal:** Use Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate business recommendations.  
- **Key Skills:** Python scripting, EDA, univariate/multivariate analysis, data visualization, and insight generation.

## Data
- **Rows:** 1,898  
- **Columns:** 9  
- **Key Fields:**  
  - `restaurant_name`  
  - `cost_of_the_order`  
  - `food_preparation_time`  
  - `delivery_time`  
  - `rating`

## Key Findings
- **Revenue Distribution:** Shake Shack is a clear outlier, generating significantly higher revenue than other restaurants:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
- **Delivery Times:** Faster on weekends (~22 min) than weekdays (~28 min):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Lower ratings correlated with longer prep/delivery times; higher-cost orders were more likely to earn 5 stars:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- **Cuisine Effects:** Certain cuisines had longer preparation times, impacting delivery efficiency and ratings:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

## Recommendations
- **Optimize Delivery Efficiency:** Add more drivers during weekday peaks:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
- **Customer Transparency:** Provide delivery time estimates upfront; introduce a ‚ÄúFast Delivery‚Äù badge for restaurants with <25 min avg. delivery:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
- **Promotions:** Prioritize high-rated restaurants (>50 reviews) for campaigns:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  
- **Revenue Strategy:** Encourage upselling with combo discounts on orders >$20; implement a tiered commission model:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.
