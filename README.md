# AI & Machine Learning Portfolio â€” UT Austin Program

âš¡ **Note:** All projects here are **personal / academic work** completed outside of my role at Electronic Arts (EA).  
They reflect my independent learning, upskilling, and interest in AI/ML + Analytics Engineering â€” not proprietary EA work.

## ðŸŽ“ Program Overview
This repository contains my projects from the **UT Austin Post-Graduate Program in AI & Machine Learning (2025)**.  
The program covered **Python, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, NLP, Computer Vision, Advanced ML, and Model Deployment**.  

âœ… Certificate of Completion included: [View Certificate](./certificate/UT_AI_ML_Certificate.pdf)
