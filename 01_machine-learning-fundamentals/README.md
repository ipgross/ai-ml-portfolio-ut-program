# Project 1 â€” Machine Learning Fundamentals

ðŸ“Œ **Personal / Academic project (outside of EA).**

---

## Overview
This project explores the fundamentals of **machine learning** using Python.  
It covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression, classification, and model evaluation.

- **Goal:** Build baseline models and evaluate their performance  
- **Key Skills:** EDA, feature engineering, scikit-learn pipelines, metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, AUC)  

---

## Contents
- `notebook.ipynb` â†’ Google Colab notebook with full workflow  
- `slides.pdf` â†’ presentation summarizing the project  
- `data.csv` â†’ dataset used for training/testing  

---

## Results
- Compared multiple baseline ML models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests)  
- Evaluated models with accuracy, recall, and AUC metrics  
- Identified feature importance and patterns in the dataset

## How to Explore
1. Open the notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) in Jupyter or Google Colab  
2. Review the dataset (`data.csv`)  
3. View the slide deck (`slides.pdf`) for summary and results
